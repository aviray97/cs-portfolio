      <p>Dance is a <strong>big</strong> part of my life. I have been dancing for 12 years, in all different styles but mostly in ballet. To me, dance is not just an extracurricular activity, it is an art, and <em>a different way of expressing myself</em>. Here, I will tell you some about some things you may not know about dance.</p>
      
      <h3>Different Styles of Dance</h3>
      <p>As you may know, there are many different styles of dance. Here are some styles, just to name a few-
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#ballet">Ballet</a></li>
        <li><a href="#modern">Modern/ Lyrical/ Contemporary</a></li>
        <li>Jazz</li>
        <li>Tap</li>
        <li><a href="#hiphop">Hip Hop</a></li>
        <li>Hula</li>
        <li>Ballroom</li>
        <li>And many more</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Normal people don't really see dance the same way dancers do. Dancers see dance as a lifestyle and also a way to express themselve. Normal people, can just perceive dance as an extracurriclar activity that is fun or another form of exercise. Usually when people think about dance, they sometimes think of TV shows like "Dancing with the Stars," "Dance Moms," and even "So You Think You Can Dance." Most of the time, these TV shows don't show dance the way it actually is. I will get more in depth on this topic later.
      <h3>Let's start to know some of the different styles</h3>
      <h4 id="ballet">Ballet</h4>

      <p>Ballet is practically the building block for other styles of dance. Ballet is a performing art, originated from the Italian Renaissance. Ballet is known worldwide for being a highly technical form of dance. One cannot master this style, there are always things to improve. Ballet requires many hours of practice in technique class. <br> The most famous ballets are <em>The Nutcracker</em> and <em> Swan Lake</em>. Many ballet works are performed with classical music and elaborate costumes and props. Some of the most famous ballet companies are the <em> Mariinsky Ballet Theatre</em>, located in St. Petersburg, Russia and <em>Paris Opera Ballet</em>, located in Paris, France. These companies are known for their excellent quality in technique and performances. <br>Ballet technique is the foundational principles of body movement and form used in ballet. One distinctive feature of technique is "turn out" or the outward rotation from the hips. There are five main positions of feet, named numerically as <em> first</em> through <em> fifth</em> positions. <em>Pointe technique</em> is one of the techniques everyone knows. Pointe, is when dancers wear special shoes and dance on the tips of their toes.

      <h4 id="modern">Modern, Lyrical, Contemporary</h4>

      <p>Modern dance is a broad genre of western concert and theatrical dance. Modern dance is practically the same as <em>Contemporary</em> and <em>Lyrical</em>. Modern is a free, expressive style of of dance. Contemporary dance, stresses versatility and imporvisation, unlike the strict, structured nature of ballet. Lyrical dance is a fusion of ballet with jazz and modern. These styles of dance are a lot more forgiving than ballet. What I mean by this, is that you don't need perfect positions, or the perfect body for this. You just have to emote and really commit to your movements. <br>I am going to skip over some of the styles and move to <em>Hip Hop.</em></p>
      
      <h4 id="hiphop">Hip Hop</h4>
      <p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:B-boy_breakdancing.jpg#/media/File:B-boy_breakdancing.jpg"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/B-boy_breakdancing.jpg/1200px-B-boy_breakdancing.jpg" alt="A b-boy performing in Turkey surrounded by a group of spectators." width="230"></a><br>"<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:B-boy_breakdancing.jpg#/media/File:B-boy_breakdancing.jpg">B-boy breakdancing</a>" by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.flickr.com/people/51886338@N00">E.

      <p> Hip Hop refers to "street" dance styles. There are many styles to Hip Hop too, there is <em>Popping</em>, <em> Locking</em>, and <em> Breaking</em>, just to name a few. Hip Hop has the beat that makes you want to get up and dance. Recently, there have been a lot of TV shows and music releases about Hip Hop. <em>America's Best Dance Crew</em>, <em>Step Up</em>and <em>Soul Train</em>, are some of the shows and movies that came out recently.
