    <p>Ballet originated from the Italian Renaissance in the 15th century. Noblemen and woman were treated to elaborate events, where dance and music created an elaborate performance. Dance masters taught steps to the noble class and the court would participate
        in the performances. In the 16th century, <em>Catherine de Medici</em>- wife of King Henry II of France- began to fund ballet in the french court. King Louis XVI helped ballet become popular and standardize the art form. As a passionate dancer
        himself, he also performed many roles, including the Sun King in <em>Ballet de la nuit</em>. His love for ballet promoted it from being a pastime for amateurs to an endeavor requiring <em>professional</em> training.</p>
    <p>By 1661, a dance academy had opened in Paris. In 1681, ballet had moved from the courts to the stage. By the mid 1700s French ballet master <em>Jean Georges Noverre</em> believed that ballet can stand alone as its own art form. His belief- that ballet
        should contain expressive, dramatic movement that should reveal the relationships between characters- introduced the <em>balle d'action</em> a dramatic style of ballet that conveys a narrative. </p>
    <p> Early ballets, such as <em>Giselle</em> and <em>La Sylphide</em> were created during the Romantic Movement, in the first half of the 19th century. They focused on the supernatural world of spirits and magic and often showed woman as passive and fragile.
        This was also the time when ballerinas started dancing on their toes, known as "pointe" and became the norm of a ballerina. The romantic tutu, a calf-length, full skirt, made of tulle, was introduced. </p>
    <p>In the later half of the 19th century, popularity of ballet soared in Russia. Russian composers and choreographers took ballet to new heights. Marius Petipa, creator of <em>The Nutcracker</em>; <em>The Sleeping Beauty</em>; and <em> Swan Lake</em>,
        represented ballet in its biggest form. He focused on showing the classical technique to the fullest. Complicated combinations that show off difficult steps, high jumps and turns were choreographed to the story. The classical tutu, much shorter
        and stiffer than the romantic tutu, was introduced to show a ballerina's legs and the difficult movement.</p>

    <p>Modern dance was created in America during the 20th century, when a number of choreographers and dancers rebelled against ballet and vaudeville- the two forms of dance prevalent at the time. Loie Fuller, Isadora Duncan, Ruth St. Denis, and Ted Shawn
        are considered to be the pioneers of Modern Dance.</p>
    <h4>Loie Fuller</h4>
    <p>In 1891, she began experimenting with gas lighting on her silk costumes. She developed a natural movement and improvisation techniques that were used with her revolutionary lighting and translucent silk costumes. Most of the movement was performed
        with the arms, because she had minimal dance training. She emphasized visual effect rather than storytelling or emotions.</p>
    <h4>Isadora Duncan</h4>
    <p>Isadoray Duncan is considered the founding mother of American modern dance, she is largely self-taught. She was truly revolutionary. She changed from the corset, slippers, and tutu of normal ballet dress, and changed to tunics that freed the body
        and showed body movement. She spoke of her dancing not as entertaining but as art with a high moral purpose. Her dance vocabulary was simple but with a musicality, dynamic subtlety, and charisma that made it powerfully expressive.</p>
    <h4>Ruth St. Denis</h4>
    <p>Ruth St. Denis was born in a Bohemian environment and was encouraged to perfom at a very young age. She called her dances <strong>translations</strong>, which were inspired by Eastern cultures and mythologies including those from Inda and Egypt. By
        1906, she had found the essence of her distinctive style, which combined spiral form with equal parts voluptuousness, mysticism, and erotica. She became a famous soloist and in 1914, she got a professional and personal partner <em>Ted Shawn</em>
        <h4>Ted Shawn</h4>
        <p>Ted Shawn had opened a studio, two years after meeting Ruth St. Denis, called <em><strong>Denishawn</strong></em>. As a school and company, they had nurtured many leaders of the next wave of modern dancers. Denis was responsible for most of the
            creative work, and Shawn was responsible for teaching the technique.</p>

        <p>Jazz dance is often credited as an American creation, but it actually originates from African Amercian dance that came about during the late 1800s. Jazz roots trace further back than vaudeville, many moves being created by the slaves as a physical
            and emotional outlet. Slave traders often let the slaves dance during their journeys, to keep them physically fit. Not only did their method work, but it formed an impressive series of techniques and steps that made history. The orginal steps
            were exemplified out of the plantations and jazz dance itself came about a crossbreed of American culture, European jigs and the music and movement traditons of the African slaves. Europe lent elegance to the technique, Africa gave it its
            movement and rhythm, and America allowed it to have the exposure and the growing popularity.</p>

        <p>Like many things American, tap dance involves a mixture of cultures and peoples, specifically African American slaves and Irish indentured servants. In the mid 1600s, in cotton fields and bunkhouses, West African drumming and dance traditions
            merged with Irish clog and step dancing dancing to create a new style of dance. Tap dancing began to formally perform on stage in the mid 1800s. By the later part of the century, wooden shoes were the norm. Tap dance reached its peak of popularity
            from 1920-40. It was during this period where exceptional dancers such as, Fred Astaire, and Bill "Bojangles" Robinson regularly performed in movies and Vaudeville. Tap later started to lose its popularity in the 1950s when rock 'n' roll became
            mainstream.

        <p>The history of hip hop dance surrounds the people and events since the late 1960s. There are many different styles of hip hop dancing, there is <em>uprock</em>, <em>breaking</em>, <em>locking</em>, <em>roboting</em>, <em>boogaloo</em>, <em>and popping</em>.
            Black Americans and Latino Americans created uprock and breaking in New York City. Black Americans in California created locking, roboting, boogaloo, and popping, often reffered to as the <strong>funk styles</strong>. Hip hop dance became
            widely known after the first professional street-based dance crews were formed in the 1970s in the United States. Some of the groups who are responsible for the spread of the different hip hop styles are <em>Rock Steady Crew</em>, <em>New York City Breakers</em>,
            <em>The Lockers</em>, and <em>The Electric Boogaloos</em>. Let's talk about the different styles of hip hop.</p>
        <p>Although there are many different hip hop dance crews, <strong>The Company</strong>, is my favorite dance crew. They focus on being synchronized with one another instead of having tricks in their dances. Here is a video of The Company.</p>

        <p>Hula is a dance form accompanied by a chant or a song. It was created in the Hawaiian Islands by the Polynesians who orginally settled there. Hula is a complex form of dance, there are many hand motions used to represent words in the a song or
            chant. Hand movements can symbolize aspects of nature, such as the swaying tree in the breeze or a wave in the ocean, or a feeling of emotion, such as fondness and yearning. Foot and hip movements often pull from a basic library of steps.
            Hula is unique to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>

        <p>Ballroom dance is a set of partner dances, which are enjoyed both socially and competitively around the world. Because of its performance and entertainment aspects, ballroom dance is also widely enjoyed on stage, film and television. The ballroom
            dance repetoire includes dances developed from old European folk dances such as the waltz, Latin American dances such as the tango, rumba, and cha-cha, and dances of the 20th century origin such as the foxtrot and quickstep. </p>
